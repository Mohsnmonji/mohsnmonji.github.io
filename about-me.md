<!-- RESEARCH PROGRAM SECTION -->
<div class="about-section">
  <h2>Research Program</h2>
  <div class="about-card">
    <p>
      I work at the intersections of critical Indigenous studies, Black feminist thought, and critical public health to explore how historical and ongoing systems of power and inequality—including colonialism and racial capitalism— shape health policies, systems, and outcomes in settler colonial contexts. My research program revolves around three areas:
    </p>

    <h4>1. Intersectionality and Mental Health</h4>
    <p>
      I draw on Black feminist theory and intersectionality to examine how racism, sexism, and other forms of social inequality intersect and shape mental health outcomes. I am particularly interested in the epistemological implications of intersectionality for population health research, especially in relation to mental health outcomes.
    </p>

    <h4>2. Settler Colonialism and Health Governance</h4>
    <p>
      Drawing on critical Indigenous studies and Black feminist thought, I examine settler colonialism as a fundamental cause of health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. In particular, I explore how population health surveillance and healthcare systems reproduce colonial logics—not only in how data on Indigenous health is collected and governed, but also in how it informs policy in ways that marginalize Indigenous knowledge systems.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Social History of Statistics and Psychiatry</h4>
    <p>
      Another strand of my research examines the social history of modern statistics and psychiatry, focusing on the historical conditions under which statistical knowledge and psychiatric discourses emerged and became central—epistemologically—to knowledge production about health and population health governance.
