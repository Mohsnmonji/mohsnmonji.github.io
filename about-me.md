    I am a <strong>PhD Candidate and Lecturer in Sociology</strong> at 
    <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/sociology-anthropology.html" target="_blank">Concordia University</a>. 
    My primary research interests are in the areas of the 
    <strong>social determinants of health</strong> and 
    <strong>access to health care</strong> in Canada, with a focus on 
    <strong>mental health</strong> and <strong>dental health</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Broadly, my research program is concerned with
    <strong>disparities</strong> in <strong>health outcomes</strong> and <strong>access to health care</strong> at the population level. 
    My doctoral dissertation specifically examines the application of what have been termed as
    <strong>intersectional quantitative methods</strong> to the analysis of 
    <strong>population mental health disparities</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Methodologically, I am interested in <strong>quantitative research methods</strong>, 
    <strong>survey methodology</strong>, <strong>social statistics</strong>, and <strong>machine learning</strong>, 
    with a particular focus on large-scale surveys with complex sampling designs.

  <h3><i class="fas fa-quote-left icon"></i> Health Equity Tourism</h3>
  <p style="font-style: italic; text-align: justify;">
    Diversity. Equity. Inclusion. Anti-Racism. Intersectionality. These are words with rich meanings, theoretical traditions, and scholarly legacies that are meant to inform the practice of pursuing cross-disciplinary justice, grassroots organizing, political advocacy, and scientific inquiry. Recently, they have also become buzzwords that have been shuffled into seemingly meaningless acronyms at healthcare institutions and research organizations. These same words are surfacing in requests for applications at major funding agencies and calls for papers from top health journals. The nascent fervor of soliciting equity-influenced work is linked to a magnification of racial injustice that has given a fresh lens for individuals who had not previously engaged in the work. This ideological shift has influenced funding streams, leaving academic researchers clamoring to adapt to these current shifts in the priorities of funding agencies and journals, and creating a predatory co-opting of scholarship that has been rigorously studied by equity scholars and social scientists for decades.
    <br><br>
    It is in this environment that we witness the evolution of the “health equity tourism” phenomena. We define “health equity tourism” as the practice of investigators—without prior experience or commitment to health equity research—parachuting into the field in response to timely and often temporary increases in public interest and resources. Health equity tourists fail in developing an enduring equity-focused research arms because they are reactionary rather than prospective. Tourists come to equity work because they recognize it is a viable option for research productivity and fiscal return rather than a long-standing commitment to health justice. Indeed, this type of academic tourism is often a definite departure from primary research focuses, framing “health justice” as a fruitful landscape waiting to be cultivated. Oftentimes, these scholars seek to “retrofit,” or adapt existing structures and research practices for health equity work, rather than build the necessary transformative infrastructure required for and sustainable health justice.
