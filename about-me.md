<!-- CARD 1: ABOUT ME -->
<div class="about-card">
  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <p>
    I am a sociologist of health and knowledge working at the intersections of critical Indigenous studies, Black feminist thought, and decolonial public health to examine how historical and ongoing systems of power and inequality—including colonialism and racial capitalism—shape health systems, policies, and outcomes in settler colonial contexts.
    I am currently a PhD candidate in Sociology at 
    <a href="https://www.concordia.ca/" target="_blank">Concordia University</a> and a CRDCN Emerging Scholar with the 
    <a href="https://crdcn.ca" target="_blank">Canadian Research Data Centre Network (CRDCN)</a>. 
    During the 2024–2025 academic year, I was a Doctoral Fellow at the 
    <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/cand3/" target="_blank">Consortium on Analytics for Data-Driven Decision-Making (CAnD3)</a> at 
    <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/" target="_blank">McGill University</a>.

<!-- CARD 3: RESEARCH PROGRAM -->
<div class="about-card">
  <h2>RESEARCH PROGRAM</h2>
  
  <p>My research program revolves around two broad areas:</p>

  <h4>1. Intersectionality and Health Disparaties</h4>
  <p>
    I draw on Black feminist thought - particularly through the lens of intersectionality- to examine how racism, sexism, and other systems of oppression intersect and shape mental health outcomes. I am particularly interested in the epistemological implications of intersectionality for population health research, especially in relation to mental health outcomes.
  </p>

  <h4>2. Settler Colonialism and Indigenous Health</h4>
  <p>
    Drawing on critical Indigenous studies and settler colonial studies, I examine settler colonialism as a fundamental cause of health disparities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples. In particular, I am concerned with the ways in which colonial laws, policies, and institutions have undermined—and continue to undermine—Indigenous well-being in Canada.
