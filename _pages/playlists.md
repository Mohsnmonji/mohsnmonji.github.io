<p>Here you can find the music and sounds I listen to. These mixes range widely, but they often revolve around a few constants: dreamy atmospheres, retro synth textures, melancholic melodies, dark wave, underground hits, and electro pop. I’m a big fan of Boy Harsher and similar sounds that live somewhere between eerie and hypnotic. If you’ve got suggestions or want to talk music, I’m always up for it.</p>
