  <!-- Description -->
  <p style="font-size:18px; color:#333; text-align:justify; line-height:1.8; margin:20px 0;">
    I am a Bakhtiari and Qashqai scholar, Indigenous to the Zagros Mountains, working at the
    intersections of critical Indigenous studies, Black feminist thought, and decolonial public
    health. My research explores how historical and ongoing systems of power and inequality—including
    colonialism and racial capitalism—shape health policies, systems, and outcomes in settler-colonial
    contexts.
